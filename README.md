# c-Project-
A simple hotel management system coded in C as a first-semester project with Abhijon Dhungana.
It supports basic hotel operations such as:
- Adding and deleting menu items (admin side)
- Viewing the menu (both user and admin)
- Creating a bill based on selected items (user side)
  
I also made some frontend web projects during my +2, but I lost those files.
